Affordances are the possible uses of an object in its environment. For web, this has a much more limited application since it is all digital, and is usually limited to things like clicking or typing.

Advantages of using third-party systems: You can use anything that exists on the internet with a valid URL (that you have legal rights to use, of course), and you don't have to have the file stored on your computer taking up a bunch of space.
Disadvantages of using third-party systems: If the file is deleted or moved from its original URL, you lose it and your website just has a blank space.
