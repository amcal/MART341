          Excerpt from Chapter 1:

          While Antoinette touched up her eye makeup, the mouse father put Despereaux down on a bed made of blanket scraps. The April sun, weak but determined, shone through a castle window and from there squeezed itself through a small hole in the wall and placed one golden finger on the little mouse.

          The other, older mice children gathered around to stare at Despereaux.

          "His ears are too big," said his sister Merlot. "Those are the biggest ears I've ever seen."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Look," said a brother named Furlough, "his eyes are open. Pa, his eyes are open. They shouldn't be open."
        </p>
        <p>
          It is true. Despereaux's eyes should not have been open. But they were. He was staring at the sun reflecting off his mother's mirror. The light was shining onto the ceiling in an oval of brilliance, and he was smiling up at the sight.

          "There's something wrong with him," said the father. "Leave him alone."
        </p>
        <p>
          Despereaux's brothers and sisters stepped back, away from the new mouse.

          "This is the last," proclaimed Antoinette from her bed. "I will have no more mice babies. They are such the disappointment. They are hard on my beauty. They ruin, for me, my looks. This is the last one. No more."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The last one," said the father. "And he'll be dead soon. He can't live. Not with his eyes open like that."
        </p>
        <p>
          But, reader, he did live.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is his story.
