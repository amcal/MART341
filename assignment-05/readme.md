Assignment 5

I visited the New York Times site from 1996 and the interface was much different. Instead of adjusting to fit the size of the browser, it was a static image with only one place to click to see everything (though the link was not actually archived by the Wayback Machine). On the current website, there are lots of articles to click on on the home page. There are also more images, including some that loop.
